Examples:

basic
- LP
- QP
- SOCP
- SDP

graph
- single commodity flow
- max flow that returns min cut
- electrical grid from Eric's paper
- social network
- latency
- flow control (fixed paths with delay = sum of latency)

control
- optimal control
- MPC

layout

SOC controlled spaceship

portfolio optimization
- static
- time series

parallel
- 10 fold CV (testing error vs training error) for SVM?
- trade off curve
- Monte Carlo

biconvex 
- non-negative matrix factorization
- missing data

ADMM
- consensus
- standard form f(x) + g(z) s.t. Ax + Bz = c

images
- foreground vs background classifier
- convolutions

Bugs:

Features:

Finish README (mainly DCP and intro on dcp.stanford.edu)
transpose and index for parameter.
transpose of any expression.
Multiplication on the right
Switch from object id to variable id so index and transpose can be grouped together?
Add scipy sparse matrix support
Interface for is_dcp
Fix matrix packing so doesn't scalarize everything (by column)
simplify when objective or constraint constructed so only need to stuff parameters in the matrix
Organize atoms
Switch from cvxopt to numpy matrices
SDP
exponential cone
expression.value
Organize parse tree
Flatten addition chains.
Variable attributes (e.g. Positive) - BoolVar vs Variable("boolean")
Fix returned statuses for numerical problems in ECOS

Long term:

targeting QCML
put constraints_matrix function in C
branch and bound extension
thread safety
large data sets
ADMM canonicalization
simplification of parse tree (i.e. compiling)
